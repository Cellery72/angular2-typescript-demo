# Angular2 Typescript Demo App with Express
This is a simple web application using [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) with [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) to build the project.


## Setup
1. Download/Clone this repository.
2. `cd angular2-typescript-demo`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm start` to build/start our app

**Note:** If you want to use nodemon you must run `webpack` prior to the `nodemon server.js` command as it must build the output directory with the compiled javascript files from your Angular project.

## Issues
If you're running into an issue with npm and dependencices ('The package does not satisfy its siblings peerDependencies' or such) you must update npm to the latest version globally on your machine.

`npm install npm -g`

After this re-run your `npm install` command and it should succesfully conclude.
